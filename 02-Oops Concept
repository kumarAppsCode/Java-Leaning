Java: Object oriented programming language
c:Procedural Language
programming language----High level =======Human understandable
          					----middle level======Procedural language(C) 
                    ----low level ========Assemble Language(can't able to understand)
                    ----very low level====pure machine language 


1. Class 
2. Object
3. Abstraction
4. Inheritance
5. Interface
6. Encapsulation
7. Polymorphism

Procedure language- no safety
Oops--------------- Hide the data, develop and maintain code is easy.solve the real time problem.

Class:
      Collection of objects is called class. 
      It is a logical entity.
      Method
      fields
      Constructor 

Object: 3 type
          1. Identity ---name
          2. state    ---colour
          3. behaviour---wt can we do?
          It is a runtime entity.
          
Abstraction: It means elimination
             Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction
             For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing
             abstraction: abstract class + interface           

Inheritance: derive subclass from Parent class.(Deriving new class from it's exiting class, with it's own properties)
	      		 one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object(Code re-useable)
             Type: 
                1. Single
                2. Multi-level
                3. hierarchy
                2. Multiple-not used in java(we go for interface)
                
Interface:  only Method and signature		

Encapsulation: Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation
			         secure data
Polymorphism: When one task is performed by different ways is called Polymorphism
              to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.
